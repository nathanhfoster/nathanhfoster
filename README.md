A lifelong learner and charismatic software engineer with a passion for web development. Striving to stand on the vanguard of technology and innovate immersive digital experiences that make life better. I am a leader that galvanizes people. I value craftsmanship. I am an expert in JavaScript, React, and Redux with years of experience taking enterprise applications to the next level. I have been building progressive web applications for several years in React, Redux, and Django. I have written my own state management library that uses the React's latest useContext and useReducer hooks. I have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and take the initiative to cultivate a collaborative environment, deliver technical solutions, and make an impact on teams, business, and the lives of people. I constantly seek to add value to all areas for my team and my clients. When I am not on the keyboard I am analyzing business and client needs, minimizing technical debt, maximizing scalability and performance, focusing on user experience, and building meaningful relationships.
